            The information returned by the pResidencyStatus argument array describes the residency status at the time that the QueryResourceResidency method was called.

If you call the QueryResourceResidency method during a device removed state, the pResidencyStatus argument will return the DXGI_RESIDENCY_EVICTED_TO_DISK flag. Note??This method should not be called every frame as it incurs a non-trivial amount of overhead.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers. Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling {{FreeLibrary}}. The typical calling scenario is to call {{LoadLibrary}}, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call {{FreeLibrary}} on the DLL and forget the DLL's {{HMODULE}}. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

            Find the display mode that most closely matches the requested display mode.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats. This method finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode specified in pModeToMatch. Similarly ranked fields (ie. all specified, or all unspecified, etc) are resolved in the following order.  ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRate  When determining the closest value for a particular field, previously matched fields are used to filter the display mode list choices, and  other fields are ignored. For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen. Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order. If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

            <param name="device">A reference to the Direct3D device interface. If this parameter is NULL, only modes whose format matches that of pModeToMatch will  be returned; otherwise, only those formats that are supported for scan-out by the device are returned. </param>

Members of DXGI_MODE_DESC can be unspecified indicating no preference for  that member.  A value of 0 for Width or Height indicates the value is unspecified.  If either Width or  Height are 0 both must be 0.  A numerator and denominator of 0 in RefreshRate indicate it is unspecified. Other members  of DXGI_MODE_DESC have enumeration values indicating the member is unspecified.  If pConnectedDevice is NULL Format cannot be DXGI_FORMAT_UNKNOWN. </param>

            <remarks>	
            In general, when switching from windowed to full-screen mode, a swap chain automatically chooses a display mode that meets (or exceeds) the resolution, color  depth and refresh rate of the swap chain. To exercise more control over the display mode, use this API to poll the set of display modes that are validated  against monitor capabilities, or all modes that match the desktop (if the desktop settings are not validated against the monitor). As shown, this API is designed to be called twice. First to get the number of modes available, and second to return a description of the modes.

            Creates a swap chain.	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED will be returned. If the buffer width or the buffer height are zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description. Since the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure the sizes match:  Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)"/>. Save a reference to the swap-chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.  If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it, you must use {{SetFullscreenState}} to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the Destroying a Swap Chain section of {{DXGI Overview}}.
